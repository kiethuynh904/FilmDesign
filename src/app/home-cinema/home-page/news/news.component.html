                Many of the big season eight questions have already been answered, like how the White Walkers are
                defeated, how Cersei bites the dust, and whether or not the showrunners knew where they were going all
                along. After a, shall we say, divisive penultimate episode, we are left with a deeply twisted
                happily-ever-after – the exiled ‘rightful’ queen Daenerys has claimed the throne, ready to rid Westeros
                of tyrants. Unfortunately, she blew everything up in the process. Where does that leave us for the
                finale? Here are the questions that still need to be answered.
